  "sentences": "An <<||>> characterizes a substance or a <<||>>, in the sense of the Forms or Ideas in <<||>>. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal; and present in every possible world. Classical <<||>> has an essentialist conception of the human being, which means that it believes in an eternal and unchangeable <<||>>. The idea of an unchangeable human nature has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, and many other <<||>> thinkers. In Plato's philosophy things were said to come into being in this world by the action of a <<||>> who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Many definitions of essence hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the <<||>> of the things of this world. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artifact produced by a craftsman. The <<||>> requires hyle (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in his own mind according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (morphe). Aristotle was the first to use the terms hyle and morphe. According to his <<||>>, all entities have two aspects, 'matter' and 'form'. It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity, its <<||>> or 'whatness'. Via wikipedia.org",
