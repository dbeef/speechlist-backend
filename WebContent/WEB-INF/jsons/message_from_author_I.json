  "sentences": "Hi, Daniel here. Thanks for downloading this app. Since last 7 days Speechlist got more than 150 new users. For this, I am announcing a new version which will be uploaded in the end of october. Many of you complained about not so clear interface, lack of black/white colour switch and too long tests. These will be repaired soon, also I am going to provide deleting tests from app level, so you could delete messages like this one. Sorry for not uploading new tests yesterday, had much more school work than I expected, I will do it this evening. Have a good day (or night!). 2016-10-14",
